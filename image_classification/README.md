Here is a beginner-friendly version of your README:

# **Notes on Building a Machine Learning Project**

This document explains the steps and insights involved in building a machine learning project. It includes details from preparing the dataset to training and testing the model.

## **Dataset**

The dataset can be found here:  
[Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rizkyyk/dataset-food-classification/data)

## **Organizing the Dataset**  

The dataset is organized by renaming and formatting image files in their folders. The process includes:  
1. Renaming files to match their folder names and adding numbers (e.g., `cat_001.jpg`).  
2. Converting unsupported image formats to `.jpg`.  
3. Removing original files after renaming.  

The code used for this process is in: [`organize_image.py`](https://github.com/NV-Bite/Develop-ML/blob/main/image_classification/organize_image.py)   

## Split Dataset

available at [`data_splitting.ipynb`](../scripts/data_splitting.ipynb)

the output is 3 folders = `train, test, and valid`

## **Dataset Preparation**

### **Loading an Image**

This function loads an image from the given path and preprocesses it by resizing and normalizing it.

```python
def load_image(image_path: str) -> tf.Tensor:
    # Loads and preprocesses an image
```

### **Loading the Dataset**

This function loads images and their labels into arrays for training, testing, or validation.

```python
def load_dataset(root_path: str, class_names: list, trim: int=None) -> Tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray]:
    # Loads all images and labels from the given path
```

### **Using the Functions**

We use these functions to load the dataset for training, testing, and validation:

```python
X_train, y_train = load_dataset(root_path=train_dir, class_names=class_names)
X_valid, y_valid = load_dataset(root_path=valid_dir, class_names=class_names)
X_test, y_test = load_dataset(root_path=test_dir, class_names=class_names)
```

---

## **Testing the Model**

We test the trained model using the test dataset to check its performance:

```python
test_loss, test_acc = xception.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print(f"Loss    : {test_loss:.4}")
print(f"Accuracy: {test_acc*100:.4}%")
```

---

## **Improving the Model with Hyperparameter Tuning**

### **Defining the Model**

The model is built using this function, which includes options for changing the number of layers, dropout rates, and units:

```python
def build_model(hp, n_classes=13):
    # Builds a model with tunable hyperparameters
```

### **Random Search for the Best Settings**

We use Random Search to find the best hyperparameters:

```python
random_searcher = kt.RandomSearch(
    hypermodel=build_model,
    objective='val_loss',
    max_trials=10,
    seed=42,
    project_name="XceptionSearch",
)
random_searcher.search(train_generator, validation_data=validation_generator, epochs=10)
```

### **Callbacks for Training**

These callbacks help improve training by saving the best model and stopping early if the model stops improving:

```python
from keras.callbacks import EarlyStopping, ModelCheckpoint
```

### **Training the Best Model**

We train the best model from the Random Search:

```python
best_xception = build_model(random_searcher.get_best_hyperparameters(num_trials=1)[0])
best_xception.compile(
    loss='categorical_crossentropy',
    optimizer=Adam(LEARNING_RATE*0.1),
    metrics=['accuracy']
)
best_xception.fit(
    train_generator,
    validation_data=validation_generator,
    epochs=50,
    callbacks=[
        EarlyStopping(patience=2, restore_best_weights=True),
        ModelCheckpoint("BestXception.h5", save_best_only=True)
    ]
)
```

---

## **Loading the Best Model**

You can load the saved model for testing or deployment:

```python
best_xception = tf.keras.models.load_model('model.h5')
best_xception.summary()
```
